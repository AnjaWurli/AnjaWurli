You might be wondering about my unusual professional background. Let me tell you about it: 
After being frustrated in the all day work life routine as a distiller, I went on the journey to find my true purpose.

Because here I can always find new challenges, learn new things and solve fascinating problems in creative ways.
IT here I am, thanks for having me ğŸ¤©
